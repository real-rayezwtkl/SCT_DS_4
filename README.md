# Traffic Accident Analysis & Hotspot Visualization task - SkillCraftTechnology Internship

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes traffic accident data to identify patterns related to time of day, weather conditions, and road severity. The goal is to uncover meaningful insights and visualize accident hotspots to better understand contributing factors to road accidents.

📂 Dataset

Source: Kaggle – US Accidents Dataset

Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents

Description:
A countrywide traffic accident dataset covering accidents across the United States with attributes related to time, location, weather, and severity.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Folium (for geospatial heatmaps)

🔍 Steps Performed

Data Cleaning

Converted timestamps to datetime format

Handled missing values

Extracted features like hour and day of week

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Accident distribution by hour of day

Accident frequency by day of week

Weather conditions during accidents

Severity-level analysis

Visualization

Bar charts for time and severity patterns

Horizontal bar charts for weather conditions

Interactive heatmap to visualize accident hotspots

📊 Key Insights

Accidents peak during morning and evening rush hours

Clear and cloudy weather still account for a high number of accidents

Higher accident density observed in urban regions

Majority of accidents fall under moderate severity levels

✅ Conclusion

This analysis demonstrates how EDA and visualization techniques can help identify accident-prone conditions and locations, which can support data-driven decisions for improving road safety.
